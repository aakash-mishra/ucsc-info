### UCSC prospective students FAQ. If you have additional questions that are not covered here, please drop me a line on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mishra-aakash/)

1. *How good is the CS program at UCSC?*  
The CS program, while not the most famous, is pretty good at UCSC. The professors are all passionate CS researchers and quite adept at what they're doing. Most courses involve fair bit of math or a research component (where you're required to read papers every week and submit your reading response as homework) or a coding compoment (a project at the end of the course/weekly assignments) - or any combination of the above. In any case, the courses are excellent and highly challenging.

2. *Fees!?*  
This is a question that I get asked a lot, and, it has two possible answers:  
- Quarterly fee if you get a TA appointment is **~5k** USD
- Quarterly fee without a TA appointment is **~11k** USD

3. *How likely is it to get a TA appointment?*  
Very. In my current batch, **every** student who applied for a TA position has got the job.

4. *What are the benefits of being a TA?*  
- 50% fee waiver (see #2 above)
- Monthly salary of ~$2200 
- Free health insurance - the UC system offers one of the most comprehensive health insurances called [UCSHIP](https://www.ucop.edu/ucship/)  


5. *What are the job/internship prospects for a UCSC grad?*  
As you might be already aware, the job scene in the US is very different from what we have in India. Jobs for students are, for the most part, quite independent of your school and therefore it all comes down to your prior industry experience + how many painful hours of your life you dedicate to leetcode (more pain = better chance of landing a good job). Having said that, everyone manages to secure a decent to high paying job in the Bay Area (or somewhere else) after graduating from UCSC. Our Alumnis work at companies like Amazon, Facebook, Walmart and the hundreds of start-ups and mid-sized companies that exist in and around the Bay Area (San Jose, Santa Clara, SF, etc). I don't have a lot more to add to this point yet, as this is only my 2nd quarter here and I've recently managed to bag an internship. 

6. *How long is the program? What is the quarter system and how is it different from the semester system?*  
The CS program is 6 quarters long. Now what does that mean? Let me first talk about the quarter system in the US. There are four quarters in a calendar year - Fall (Aug/Sep to Dec), Winter (Jan to Mar), Spring (Apr to Jun) and Summer (Jun to Aug/Sep). An academic year, on the other hand, is divided into three quarters - Fall, Winter and Spring - as the summer quarter is a break. So, 6 quarters will mean two cycles of 3-quarter-long academic year ie., Fall, Winter, Spring (and repeat). It is common for students (especially Indians, I think) to finish the program in 5 quarters.  

7. *Is UCSC a safe school?*  
Frankly, I don't know. UCSC is notoriously difficult to categorize into one of safe, moderate or ambitious schools because the annual intake of Master's CS students is quite low - around 40-50 from around the world (this was the case when I got an admit and things could have changed now). This means that even though UCSC is not ranked really high, there are just less seats and a LOT of applicants, which sounds awfully lot like India. My suggestion would be to just apply, write really good essays (focus on the diversity essay and your statements) and hope for the best.  

8. *What is the cost of living in Santa Cruz?*  
It is high! There is a perpetual housing crisis going on in Santa Cruz. Due to various reasons, there are not enough on-campus houses so students are left with no option but to live off-campus. Taking advantage of this, house owners have inflated the rent exorbitantly. To give you some perspective, I pay $750 for a shared room. A single room might cost you somwhere between $1100-1300. Other than the crazy house rent, you will pay around $50-100 monthly for utilities (gas, electricity, water, etc) and another 100-200 (based on your lifestyle) for groceries. I think it's important to mention that unlike other big cities, Santa Cruz, a small town, does NOT offer a lot of options in the groceries department. For example, there are no indian stores in SC so you won't be able to find things like frozen roti or some specific indian veggies here. The nearest Indian store is in San Jose which is a 45 minute drive.
